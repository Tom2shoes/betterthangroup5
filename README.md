# Boston Marathon Data Analysis from 2015 to 2017

# **Project Title:** Finisher of Boston Marathon 2015, 2016 & 2017

## **Team Members:**
Edward Chen, Thomas Nakamoto, Eric Song, Crystal (Shenyan) Huang

## **Project Description/Outline:**

The original data set contains the name, age, gender, country, city and state (where available), times at 9 different stages of the race, expected time, finish time and pace, overall place, gender place and division place (of 25000+ participants in the annual Boston Marathon). The project will mainly focus on applying descriptive analysis on the existing dataset. And further, by examining historical data, patterns or relationship can be discovered, where a predictive analysis can be draw from there. 

## **Research Questions to Answer:**

### **Performance Analysis**
-Performance chart (Time finished vs Number of People)
-General Performance Comparison chart (USA runner vs Foreign runner)
-Elite performance vs Normal performance vs world wide
-Pace progression elite vs normal
-Regression Analysis on Bib# vs finished time
-Total population average finish time vs top 100 average finished
-Did top 50 participants who scheduled more than one year marathon improve their performance from previous year(s)?
-Total participant vs finished participant
-Ages affect on performance time

### **Gender Analysis**
-How many female and male participants in each country?
-Show comparison of male elite vs female elite ratio
-Show which country has more male participant and which has more female participant

### **Geo Data Analysis**
-Which country has the most participants?
-Marathon day weather condition affect
-USA participants - Hometown Lat/Lng/Altitude have any correlation with time

## **Data Sets to be Used:**
-Boston Marathon data from Kaggle. Scraped from the official marathon website
