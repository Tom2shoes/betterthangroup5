Project Title: Finisher of Boston Marathon 2015, 2016 & 2017

Team Members: 
Edward Chen, Thomas Nakamoto, Eric Song, Crystal (Shenyan) Huang

Project Description/Outline:

The original data set contains the name, age, gender, country, city and state (where available), times at 9 different stages of the race, expected time, finish time and pace, overall place, gender place and division place (of 25000+ participants in the annual Boston Marathon). The project will mainly focus on applying descriptive analysis on the existing dataset. And further, by examining historical data, patterns or relationship can be discovered, where a predictive analysis can be draw from there. 

Research Questions to Answer: 

Performance Analysis
Performance chart (Time finished vs Number of People)
General Performance Comparison chart (USA runner vs Foreign runner)
Elite performance vs Normal performance vs world wide
Pace progression elite vs normal
Regression Analysis on Bib# vs finished time
Total population average finish time vs top 100 average finished
Did top 50 participants who scheduled more than one year marathon improve their performance from previous year(s)?
Total participant vs finished participant
Ages affect on performance time

Gender Analysis
How many female and male participants in each country?
Show comparison of male elite vs female elite ratio
Show which country has more male participant and which has more female participant

Geo Data Analysis
Which country has the most participants?
Marathon day weather condition affect
USA participants - Hometown Lat/Lng/Altitude have any correlation with time
